## Motivation For Building This Website


- As a backend-focused developer, I haven't worked extensively with many cool UIs, so I made this website when I was learning React.js, Three.js, and playing with CSS framework Tailwind while I take my frontend skill to the next level.
- I was looking at some recent trends and futuristic websites, and Three.js, React Fiber drew my attention - specially how these frameworks make it possible to add personalized touch and make the experience of the visitors more memorable. Integrating 3D models, appropriate amount of animations into websites keep the design minimalistic and focused, only with more dimension and an immersive digital experience.
